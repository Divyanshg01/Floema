## NOTES

-   I have not added the image minifier plugin in the project because the minifier plugins which installs with it contains vulnerabilities
-   I have not added an editor config because most of these configuration are present in my editor(neovim) default config file
-   I have a different eslint config file then used in the course because that's how I have setted up my editor to work with js projects(and it works great for me)
